README for iOSConsole
=====================

This is a pre-compiled version of iOSConsole, as part of the
SDMMobileDevice suite, used for end-to-end testing of installing
bundles onto iOS devices.

(We may eventually include this as source and build it with Xcode
or Buck, but it would add a few minutes to every build.)

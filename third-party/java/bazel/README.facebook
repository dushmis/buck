Description:
This is the query engine component of Bazel build tool.

Local modifications:
- Only imported the "src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/query2/engine/" subdirectory,
  excluding the class BlazeQueryEvalResult. This class has dependencies to a class outside the
  package and it won't be used for buck query.
- Added bazel/BUCK file in order to compile this library with Buck.

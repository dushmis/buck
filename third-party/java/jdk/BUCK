# This is a stub jar for the Compiler Tree API
# (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/jdk/api/javac/tree/overview-summary.html)
# It was created as follows:
#   buck build src/com/facebook/buck/java/abi:api-stubber
#   java -jar buck-out/gen/src/com/facebook/buck/java/abi/api-stubber.jar ${JAVA_HOME}/lib/tools.jar stub-compiler-tree-api.jar
#   <a bunch of calls to `zip -d` to delete files that aren't part of the Tree API>
